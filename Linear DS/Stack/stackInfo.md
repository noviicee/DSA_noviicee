## Operations on Stack
Mainly the following basic operations are performed on stack:

* `push()`: Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.

* `pop()`: Removes an item from the stack, if the stack is not empty. Otherwise, there will be a case of underflow.

* `peek()` or `top()`: Returns/Displays top element of stack.

* `isEmpty()`: Returns True if stack is empty, else False.

## Implementation of Stack in Python 
In Python, stack can be implemented using varioys methods-
1. Using List
2. Using [Linked List](#)
3. Using In-built modules:
   * LifoQueue
   * Collections
