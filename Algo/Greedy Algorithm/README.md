# Greedy Algorithm
--------------------

Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit.

So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are best fit for Greedy.


For example:- [Fractional Knapsack Problem](#)


Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems.


An optimization problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the following two properties:

-> At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment.

-> We get the optimal solution of the complete problem. 


If a Greedy Algorithm can solve a problem, then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem as the Greedy algorithms are in general more efficient than other techniques like [Dynamic Programming](#).

But Greedy algorithms cannot always be applied.

For example, the [Fractional Knapsack problem](#) can be solved using Greedy, but [0-1 Knapsack](#) cannot be solved using Greedy.
